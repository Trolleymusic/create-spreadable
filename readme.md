# create-spreadable

> Create a spreadable for a given Promise

A fork of [Ben Drucker's create-thenable](https://github.com/bendrucker/create-thenable) to enable the `spread` method of the promise. Mostly so I can also make a fork of [sinon-as-promised](https://github.com/bendrucker/sinon-as-promised) that supports `spread`.
